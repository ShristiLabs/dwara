# dwara

A high-performance API gateway written in Rust.

Status: pre-alpha. The workspace scaffolds the gateway; proxying arrives in M1.

## Quickstart

Requires Rust 1.94 (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`).

```sh
cargo run -p dwara-bin
```

Starts a hello listener on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (proxying arrives in
M1):

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
# dwara
```

Stop it with Ctrl-C.

## Configuration

Gateway configuration is a YAML file parsed strictly by `dwara-core`
(`parse_gateway`): unknown fields are rejected, and errors carry the
path of the offending node. A minimal valid configuration:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: main
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8080
routes:
  - name: all
    service: echo
    match:
      path:
        type: prefix
        value: /
    action:
      type: proxy
services:
  - name: echo
    upstream: echo-upstream
upstreams:
  - name: echo-upstream
    endpoints:
      - address: 127.0.0.1
        port: 9000
```

More examples live in `crates/dwara-core/tests/fixtures/` (minimal and
full). A machine-readable `json_schema()` export exists
programmatically; it is the intended canonical reference once the
schema stabilizes. The schema still churns during M1.

## Crates

| Crate | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `dwara-core` | Config model, routing types, swappable trait definitions |
| `dwara-bin` | Gateway server binary |
| `dwara-admin` | Admin / management-plane API |
| `dwara-cli` | Operator command-line client |

## Development

CI runs on pushes and pull requests to `main` (when Rust sources,
manifests, toolchain files, or the workflow itself change). Blocking
gates: `cargo fmt --check`, clippy with `-D warnings`, build, tests,
and [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) checks
(advisories, licenses, bans — policy in `deny.toml`). A CycloneDX SBOM
is generated and uploaded as an artifact on each run.

Run the same checks locally:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo deny check
```
